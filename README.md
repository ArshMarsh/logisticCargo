2. Description
BilCargo is a logistic company’s web application system for managing different users such as
customers, employees, and couriers. Every user has the ability to log in with their specified ID
and chosen password to a personalized page.
Employees are responsible for assigning packages to the appropriate couriers and delivery
branches while managing the status of packages. Couriers and delivery branches are approved by
employees and employees are responsible for assigning couriers to delivery branches. They are
also able to resolve complaints made by customers on a certain delivery by providing feedback
and managing the status of packages. Employee accounts are added by the admin. Employees
can view all the details regarding packages, couriers, delivery branches, complaints, and
customers related to them and apply filters accordingly.
Customers can freely sign up and make requests for package deliveries to their specified
recipient. Each delivery will take place after payment has been done through one of the user’s
bank accounts. During and after the completion of the delivery the customer can submit a
complaint and review the feedback provided by an employee. Customers can view all their
current and past transactions and apply filters.
Couriers initially need to apply and then be assigned by employees to a delivery branch in order
to start delivering packages. Couriers can update the status and delivery time of the packages
assigned to them by the employees
